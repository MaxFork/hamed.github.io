      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an on-line dynamic world,
I need an off-line static place of my own to work distraction free,
shut down all the sensory inputs, think, and write about life, science, parenting and technology.
This might be the place.
I am writing this with good old &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.vim.org&#34;&gt;vim&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt; generates the htmls and &lt;a href=&#34;https:/github.com&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt; serves the pages, so I always have backups!
Let see if this old fashioned and distraction free method of writing get me back in the mood of writing.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My old place was &lt;a href=&#34;https://pnoq.blogspot.com&#34;&gt;blogspot&lt;/a&gt;,
at that time, there were blogs and a google reader to read them all.
Then came facebook, twitter, linkedin and bunch of other things and eventually google reader were downgraded to google plus (too me it was a downgrade.).
They destroyed my creativity and desire to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not going to abandon my old blog, twitter, facebook and the rest.
Small things like &amp;ldquo;I went to bathroom&amp;rdquo; will go to twitter,
family and friends related materials will go to facebook but essays and interesting stuffs will be here.
And, there is always &lt;a href=&#34;https://ifttt.com&#34;&gt;IFTTT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
